      <h3> 3. Data Handling:

        Input Devices: These encompass hardware like keyboards, mice, touchscreens, and more, enabling users to input data and issue commands.
        Output Devices: Examples include monitors, printers, and speakers, which display information to users or produce tangible output.
        Data Storage: Data is securely stored in both primary (RAM) and secondary (hard drives, SSDs) storage devices. It's organized into files and folders for easy retrieval.
        Data Processing: The CPU processes data by performing arithmetic and logical operations. This encompasses tasks such as calculations, data manipulation, and decision-making based on program instructions.
        Data Transfer: Data moves seamlessly between storage, memory, and input/output devices via buses and controllers on the motherboard.
        In summary, computers function by executing stored instructions in memory using a central processing unit. The CPU processes data and communicates with various hardware components to execute tasks, all under the guidance of an operating system. Input and output devices facilitate user interaction, while storage devices hold data for short-term and long-term use. The motherboard serves as the central hub connecting these critical components.</h3>
